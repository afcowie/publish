Syntax Highlighting
===================

**EXPERIMENTAL**

When you use a fenced code block, you can optionally specify an attribute
which will be used to indicate what syntax highlighting should be done.

As with the rest of **publish**, this is based on Pandoc's mechanisms. 

Pandoc internally uses **skylighting** which is a recent update to a long
standing capability which uses Kate's (the KDE text editor) syntax
definitions. Pandoc uses that library to embellish a code block with LaTeX
commands representing the different syntax types.

Therefore, in order to render a document containing code blocks with syntax
highlighting, the LaTeX preamble must provide definitions for these
commands. The built-in preamble contains, hard-coded, all the setup
necessary for syntax highlighting to work.

The source of this is
[LatexPreamble.hs](https://github.com/oprdyn/publish/blob/master/src/LatexPreamble.hs#L97).
You can copy & paste from there or simply run a render with the `-p` option
and copy it out of the generated *00_Beginning.latex* file in _/tmp/publish-XXXXX/_.

The _actual_ source of this is `Skylighting.Format.LaTeX`
[styleToLaTeX](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/skylighting-core/docs/Skylighting-Format-LaTeX.html#v:styleToLaTeX).

If you want to customize the style, you need to redefine the
colours specified for each of the tokens.

Requiring a user to have this in their own LaTeX preamble
is not reflective of the quality user experience we're aspiring to in
**publish**. Worse, this is all very fragile. If we find a better way to
support this we would make consider breaking change to do so.
